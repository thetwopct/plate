Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

/*********************
IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
our mixins, functions, and variables that we'll be using across
the whole project.
*********************/

// normalize: http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
@import "partials/normalize";

// Sass variables
@import "partials/variables";

// typography
@import "partials/typography";

// Sass functions
@import "partials/functions";

// import mixins
@import "partials/mixins";

// CSS Grid...it's time
@import "partials/cssgrid";

/* Ye Olde Bones Grid
* Hear Ye, hear ye!
* This is the old style grid, now commented out
* You *should* make the move to css grid now but
* if you need this or can't let go, it's still here
* so uncomment to use (and comment the cssgrid out).
* Just know that Rachel Andrew is watching.
*/
// @import "partials/grid";

/**
* Gutenberg Styles.
*
* Now enqueued in a separate function in functions.php to
* keep styles out of the main stylesheet. Alternatively
* you can comment out the Gutenberg styles enqueue and 
* uncomment this below to have a single stylesheet.
* You do you.
*/
// @import "partials/gutenberg";

/*********************
IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.
*********************/

// alert boxes
@import "modules/alerts";

// buttons
@import "modules/buttons";

// forms (inputs & labels)
@import "modules/forms";

/*********************
BASE STYLESHEET
These are the base styles and it's loaded on every device. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.
*********************/

// styles in base.scss
@import "breakpoints/base";

/*********************
LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's
larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
tweeners.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 481px) {
    // styles in 481up.scss
    @import "breakpoints/481up";
}

// end of media query

/*********************
BELOW TABLET
This is for everything that's below an iPad including mobile
phones. This way we can keep mobile styles separate and not
compete with the base styles.
*********************/
@media only screen and (max-width: 767px) {
    // styles in 767down.scss
    @import "breakpoints/767down";
}

// end of media query

/*********************
TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    // styles in 768up.scss
    @import "breakpoints/768up";
}

// end of media query

@media only screen and (max-width: 899px) {
    // styles in 899down.scss
    @import "breakpoints/899down";
}

// end of media query

@media only screen and (max-width: 1029px) {
    // styles in 1029down.scss
    @import "breakpoints/1029down";
}

// end of media query

/*********************
TWEENER
This targets some trickier 'tweener' devices like large
tablets. You probably won't need to add too much to this stylesheet.
If you're not using it, delete it.
*********************/

@media only screen and (min-width: 900px) {
    // styles in 900up.scss
    @import "breakpoints/900up";
}

/*********************
DESKTOP
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 1030px) {
    // styles in 1030up.scss
    @import "breakpoints/1030up";
}

// end of media query

/*********************
LARGE VIEWING SIZE
This is for the larger monitors and possibly full screen viewers.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 1240px) {
    // styles in 1240up.scss
    @import "breakpoints/1240up";
}

// end of media query

/*********************
HIMALAYA XL 9000 SIZE
This is for super ginormous monitors like your one friend has.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 1600px) {
    // styles in 1600up.scss
    @import "breakpoints/1600up";
}

// end of media query

/*********************
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
*********************/
@media print {
    // styles in print.scss
    @import "partials/print";
}
